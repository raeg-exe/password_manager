# password_manager
Exactly as the name suggests. First personal project for boot.dev.

# WARNING! THIS IS NOT YET A FULLY SECURE TOOL!
This tool was made for my personal use and is not yet finished.
While the tool will require a master password to access by the time I turn it in for boot.dev,
the passwords that it stores WILL NOT BE ENCRYPTED!

# password_generator
The password generator is a project I've been working on for a while,
because after over 20 years on the internet, I just don't have anymore passwords in me.

For this project, I gave it one final refactor to give it more functionality such as looping if a user does an improper input
instead of just crashing, as well as password strength indication.

# To be added for this project
master password for access
json username/password storage (will eventually be encrypted)
service based retrieval (service-> username + password)
